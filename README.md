# Proxmox-Srv-io-static-mac
WARNING THIS SCRIPT IS AI GENERATED IM NOT HOLDING ANY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR IT 
i genererated this script with gpt-deepseek for the main purpose of fixing srv-io mac handling inside proxmox.
Due to the original script-user documentation for it, was hard to understand and there the scripts generated random macs for me.
I needed to have fix mac adresses for opnsense lan interface and this script helped me, I tested it on a server 2019 vm with vm reboot and ipconfig /release /renew included 
for community purposes i will leave the original proxmox forum link here just so everyone can get the idea and the starting point if they decide to do srv-io NIC passthru.
